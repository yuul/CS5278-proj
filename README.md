Vanderbilt Office Directory

As a student, I want there to be an easier way for me to reach out to university offices. Vanderbilt is a very large and complex organization and it can be difficult to find out what offices to contact if a student has a question. In addition, it is oftentimes necessary for students to make appointments with university employees and it is difficult to do so when they don’t know how to reach out to a certain office.
	The app I am building is an app that allows users to find out what university office they need to contact if they have a question and from there schedule appointments or visit their website. They would text a question to the text messaging interface and from there the app would refer them to the correct resource’s website and also provide an interface for scheduling an appointment.
	This app would be useful because it would directly improve the experience of Vanderbilt students, especially newer ones, in getting to know and understand student resources better. Also, for students that value their confidentiality, this provides a more private way to communicate with Vanderbilt organizations without having to involve other people.
